# lab0-python-to-java
This lab is designed to highlight many of the differences between Python and Java. Many of the differences are purely syntactical. Other features, like for loops, function differently. Those already familiar with Java should finish the lab and then offer to help others. This is a half week lab.

Objectives
To be able to translate a Python program to Java.
To be able to develop and run a complete Java program.
Resources
Your peers
Your instructor
The Java Standard Library. We will plan to use Java 21 this quarter.
Task overview
Retrieve the files provided for this lab by accepting the assignment on GitHub classroom using this link: LINK IN CANVAS

Note: This lab assumes you have already created a GitHub account. Also, please take a look at the instructions for how to accept a GitHub classroom assignment.

The project contains the following files:

lab00.py — A file containing python code. If you have python installed, run the file to see its output: python3 lab00.py. If you don't have python installed, you can either install it and run the file, or look at the output on your neighbor's computer. (We won't use python again after this lab.)
Lab00.java — In this file you'll write a Java version of lab00.py, including its comments.
You can run your Java code by clicking the green "Run" button in IntelliJ IDEA to run your program.

You can disregard the following files, but don't delete them:

README.md – This is the file you're currently reading.
.gitignore – (What's .gitignore?)
Demo
Demonstrate your working program to the instructor or ISA. Be prepared to show and explain your source code.

Come to lab on the due date with your lab finished.
